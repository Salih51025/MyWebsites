                <h2>ERP Application:</h2>
                <p>In this project, I developed an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) application that covers all processes from the material purchasing stage of a product to the final sale. I implemented this application using Flutter and Firebase. The application includes many important features such as tracking shipments, placing orders, recording sales, and graphs that calculate monthly net income. There are also special pages that can keep track of employees. When logged in as admin, it is possible to perform all operations. Separate user login information and passwords are defined for shippers, product preparers and other users. Users access certain pages based on their authority, thus providing a customized experience for each role.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>Custom Mobile Application for Factory: In this project, I developed a mobile application specific to a factory using Flutter. The application includes features such as shopping, adding products to the cart, adding to favorites, management via the admin panel, and profile updating. Users can view and purchase products by logging in with their email and password. Also, I integrated this mobile app with the desktop app. For this integration, I created APIs using MySQL and ensured data synchronization between the two platforms. In this way, users can enjoy the same experience on both mobile and desktop.</p>

In this project, I focused specifically on code organization and user experience. With the experience I gained for factory performance. Data such as product sales analyses, inventory management and financial reports can be viewed and analyzed instantly by users.
