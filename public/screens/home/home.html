                <p>Hello, I am 18 years old and I have a great interest in software development. I'm constantly trying to learn new things. I first started my software adventure with the goal of developing games and used Unreal Engine in this process. However, after trying for 4-5 months, I turned to mobile development as I encountered difficulties in the game development process. I developed three applications using Flutter on the mobile platform and implemented these applications while working in a company. Nowadays, I am on my way to becoming a web developer and I have started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have 1.5 years of software development experience and I am determined to learn and try everything by taking firm steps on this path.</p>
